Create an overloaded stream output operator operator<< as a stand-alone function for your DivSales class. You may not use friend .The output operator should display the division sales with labels for each quarter of a single division. Remember DivSales represents the quarterly sales of one division of a company

Use it in your main program to output the division sales for each division in the array. You will need a loop. After all divisions are displayed, display the total corporate sales for the year.

All member functions must be defined outside of the class.
